This is a simply scenario of how tickets are created by users, how the ticket is assigned an agent and priority, and ultimately closed out after resolution. There are a plethora of scenarios that can be submitted by customers. Knowing the ticket lifecycle helps to understanding how and when to escalate the ticket to the right department providing adequate support in realtime.
